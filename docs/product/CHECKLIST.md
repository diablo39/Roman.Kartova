## Phase 0: Foundation (43 stories; 2 dropped — ADR-0106)

### E-01: Project Foundation & Infrastructure

**E-01.F-01: Project Scaffolding**
- [x] E-01.F-01.S-01 — .NET solution structure with clean architecture
- [x] E-01.F-01.S-02 — React frontend project with TypeScript
- [x] E-01.F-01.S-03 — Docker Compose for local development
- [x] E-01.F-01.S-04 — Dev-stack seed data (Org A organization row matching realm tenant_id) (slice-4-cleanup — PR #18, 2026-05-01)

**E-01.F-02: CI/CD Pipeline**
- [ ] E-01.F-02.S-01 — CI pipeline (build, test, lint)
- [ ] E-01.F-02.S-02 — CD pipeline to staging
- [x] E-01.F-02.S-03 — End-to-end test infrastructure (checked-in Playwright suite): compose-orchestrated Playwright suite: rootless web container, real-UI-login-per-test, per-test pg drift fixture; 3 journeys smoke/lifecycle-override/relationship-drift; nightly+dispatch CI; relationship read-hardening query filter; gate 10 retargeted. **Verification:** DoD gates 1–5,7–10 green + gate-6 (mutation) owner-waived; gate-11 (CI-green-on-PR) pending push — see `docs/superpowers/verification/2026-07-08-e2e-test-infrastructure/dod.md`

**E-01.F-03: Database Foundation**
- [x] E-01.F-03.S-01 — Multi-tenant database schema with tenant isolation
- [x] E-01.F-03.S-02 — Database migration framework (satisfied by ADR-0085 impl, verified 2026-06-19: `Kartova.Migrator` per-module `MigrateAsync` loop + `__kartova_metadata`, RLS/REVOKE DDL carried in EF migrations across all modules, DevSeed prod-guard, docker-compose `migrator` init service, Helm `pre-install/pre-upgrade` Job, CI image build, migration integration tests). Follow-ups (optional, not blocking): DDL/DML least-privilege credential split → with deploy hardening (E-01.F-04.S-05); CD-time migrator invocation → E-01.F-02.S-02; documented `--module=<name>` selective flag is unwired (Program.cs always runs all modules)
- [x] E-01.F-03.S-03 — Append-only audit log table (security forensics + GDPR accountability; MiFID II driver dropped per ADR-0106, log retained on security grounds) — Phase 1 foundation (audit-log-foundation, 2026-06-12): Kartova.Audit module, insert-only/RLS audit_log table (DB-enforced REVOKE + tenant_isolation policy), IAuditWriter (sync in-transaction, fail-closed), per-tenant SHA-256 hash chain + AuditChainVerifier (ADR-0018). Event wiring = Phase 2. Phase 2 (audit-event-wiring, 2026-06-17): 10 Organization mutations wired to IAuditWriter (member role-change/offboard, team CRUD + membership, invitation.created, org.profile_updated); actor_display snapshot from JWT. Catalog events + System-actor/expiry-sweep deferred. Phase 2 follow-up (audit-system-actor-sweep, 2026-06-18): IAuditWriter.AppendSystemAsync (System actor, null actor_id, "System" display) + invitation-expiry sweep refactored to per-tenant ITenantScope txn writing one System invitation.expired row per expiry (RLS app-role + hash chain). Phase 2 follow-up (audit-catalog-event-wiring, 2026-06-19): 7 Catalog application mutations wired to IAuditWriter via the direct-dispatch delegates — application.registered/edited/team_assigned + a single application.lifecycle_changed (from/to/sunsetDate in data) across deprecate/decommission/reactivate/un-decommission. Audit event-wiring fully closed.

**E-01.F-04: Authentication & Authorization**
- [x] E-01.F-04.S-01 — KeyCloak configured with OIDC
- [x] E-01.F-04.S-02 — JWT validation middleware in API
- [x] E-01.F-04.S-03 — RBAC with five roles (slice 7 — PR #24, 2026-05-22; granular permission model with role→permission map; ServiceAccount deferred to Phase 5). Refined by ADR-0101 (2026-06-09): the `TeamAdmin` realm role + its `team.*` mutation claims were removed — team-admin authority is now a per-team `Admin` membership via the `TeamAdminOfThis` resource gate (realm roles: Viewer/Member/OrgAdmin). Eliminates the silent-403 footgun where a realm-Member promoted to team Admin couldn't manage their team.
- [x] E-01.F-04.S-04 — SSO login via web UI (slice 7 — PR #24, 2026-05-22; existing OIDC redirect flow satisfies the story; signed-out landing page deferred to §15.9)
- [ ] E-01.F-04.S-05 — BFF cookie-session auth (security hardening, post-MVP)

- [ ] E-01.F-06.S-05 — Webhook retry with exponential backoff
- [ ] E-01.F-06.S-06 — Auto-generated OpenAPI spec (dogfooding)

- [ ] E-01.F-08.S-02 — Elasticsearch index strategy
- [x] E-01.F-08.S-03 — Row-level security for tenant isolation

**Cross-cutting: API Contract Infrastructure**
- [x] **Cross-cutting: cursor-pagination contract.** ADR-0095 + reference impl on Applications list. (2026-05-04)

## Phase 1: Core Catalog & Notifications (54 stories)

### E-02: Entity Registry

**E-02.F-01: Application Entity Management** *(+ list filter (displayName search) + displayName-asc default sort + FilterBar collapsible panel — list-filter-surface-catalog, 2026-06-22; + lifecycle & team multi-select filters — PR #41, 2026-06-24: replaces the `includeDecommissioned` checkbox; reusable `MultiSelect` control + `multiFilters` repeated-param URL axis; pulled the team/lifecycle facets forward from E-05)*
- [x] E-02.F-01.S-01 — Register new application in catalog (slice 3 — PR #10, 2026-04-30; UI surface added in slice 4 — PR #17, 2026-04-30; TimeProvider on Application.Create — slice 6, PR #22, 2026-05-07; slice-10 amendment 2026-06-10: required owning team (`TeamId`), created-by provenance (`CreatedByUserId` immutable), membership-gated registration — ADR-0103)
- [x] E-02.F-01.S-02 — Application detail page with metadata (slice 4 — PR #17, 2026-04-30; header + metadata only, tabs deferred)
- [x] E-02.F-01.S-03 — Edit application metadata (slice 5 — PR #21, 2026-05-06; PUT /api/v1/catalog/applications/{id} with If-Match/ETag optimistic concurrency, ADR-0096)
- [x] E-02.F-01.S-04 — Application lifecycle status transitions (slice 5 — PR #21, 2026-05-06; ADR-0073 Active → Deprecated → Decommissioned linear forward, sunsetDate strict; admin override + audit + notifications deferred to follow-up slices; default-view filter — slice 6, PR #22, 2026-05-07; backward transitions (Reactivate, UnDecommission) — slice 7, PR #24, 2026-05-22; sunset-date admin override remains follow-up §15.1. Follow-up §15.1 closed (`feat/catalog-adr0073-cleanups`, 2026-07-01): OrgAdmin-gated `catalog.applications.lifecycle.override` permission + `overrideSunset` flag on `POST /decommission`, audited. Follow-up §15.7 closed same slice + **ADR-0110**: dedicated App→App `successorApplicationId` self-FK field, set on deprecate, editable via `PUT /applications/{id}/successor`; surfaced on the detail page only (see list-filter-registry.md field-addition-trigger entry). FU-1 (tampered cursor returning 500 instead of 400) fixed same slice — not a summary-table lifecycle/follow-up item.)
- [x] E-02.F-01.S-06 — Field-level ProblemDetails errors (slice-4-cleanup — PR #18, 2026-05-01)
- [x] E-02.F-01.S-07 — Move kebab-case Name validation into `Application.Create` domain invariant (slice-4-cleanup — PR #18, 2026-05-01)

**E-02.F-02: Service Entity Management** *(+ list filter (displayName search) + displayName-asc default sort + FilterBar collapsible panel — list-filter-surface-catalog, 2026-06-22; + team & health multi-select filters — on master, 2026-06-24: mirrors the Applications team filter; Services have no lifecycle so no default-hide — empty filters show all; `health` reserved-but-live infra (write path lands E-15/E-16))*
- [x] E-02.F-01.S-05 — Required minimum fields on all entity types (slice 3 — PR #10, 2026-04-30; enforced as `Application.Create` invariants for the first entity)
- [x] E-02.F-02.S-01 — Register service with endpoints and protocol (catalog-service-entity, 2026-06-20: `Service` aggregate sibling to `Application` in the Catalog module; `0..50` protocol-typed endpoints persisted as a `jsonb` owned collection (`OwnsMany().ToJson()`); `Health` defaults `Unknown` (no write path — agent feeds it later, E-15); POST/GET-by-id/cursor-list at `/api/v1/catalog/services`; required owning team + membership gate (ADR-0103); new `catalog.services.register` permission (Member+OrgAdmin) + TS parity; `service.registered` audit. No Lifecycle/edit/UI this slice. Mutation 90.10%.)
- [x] E-02.F-02.S-02 — Service detail page with health and consumers (catalog-service-ui-surface, 2026-06-20: full Services frontend surface — list page (`/catalog/services`, default sort `displayName desc` — later flipped to `displayName asc`, list-filter-surface-catalog, 2026-06-22) + Register-Service dialog with 0..50 endpoints editor + read-only detail page (`/catalog/services/:id`); Services nav promoted from disabled. Frontend-only — S-01 backend/permission/audit + real-seam tests already on master. Health renders a read-only `Unknown` badge (no write path until E-15/E-16); **consumers deferred to E-04**. Mirrors the Application UI surface (useCursorList/useListUrlState/DataTable per ADR-0095, Untitled UI per ADR-0094). Codegen client regenerated. 477 frontend tests green; all DoD gates green.)

**E-02.F-03: API Entity Management (Sync & Async)** — *model pinned by [ADR-0111](../architecture/decisions/ADR-0111-api-first-class-entity-provider-instance-fields.md) (API first-class entity; provider/instance/consumer all **edges** — revised 2026-07-04 to all-edge; exposure derived over edges; amends ADR-0068). Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-03-catalog-api-entity-design.md`.*
- [x] E-02.F-03.S-01 — Register sync API (REST/gRPC/GraphQL) — *shipped 2026-07-04 (PR #55, catalog-api-entity). API node: `Api` aggregate (style/version/optional spec-URL, team-owned), POST/GET-by-id/cursor-list, RLS `catalog_apis`, `catalog.apis.register` permission (5-sync), `api.registered` audit, sortable all cols, filters deferred. Real-seam tests (Catalog integ 229, frontend 690). All 8 always-blocking DoD gates green (gate 6 mutation waived by owner); ledger `docs/superpowers/verification/2026-07-03-catalog-api-entity/dod.md`. Downstream layers registered as follow-ups FU-1..FU-11 in the design §11: provider FK, instance FK + derived exposure, endpoint redefinition (drop protocol→description), `Api` kind in E-04 + consumer edges, System surface (E-03.F-03), async (S-02), unified view (S-03), API UI + filters, exposure opt-out, polymorphic provider. Non-blocking deep-review follow-ups: OpenAPI 422→400 annotation on GET /apis; sortBy=createdAt order / PrevCursor / CreatedBy-enrichment test refinements. **FU-9 shipped 2026-07-04** (catalog-api-ui-surface): `/catalog/apis` list + `/catalog/apis/:id` detail + Register-API dialog, mirroring the Service UI; name typeahead (`displayNameContains`) + style multi-select + team multi-select list filters via `<FilterBar>`/`useListFilters` (backend `ListApis` filter params mirror `ListServices`); sort allowlist unchanged `{displayName, style, version, createdAt}`, default `displayName asc`. Registry updated: `docs/design/list-filter-registry.md`. Remaining follow-ups FU-1..FU-8, FU-10, FU-11 still open; S-02/S-03 still open.* **API connectivity via edges shipped 2026-07-05** (catalog-api-connectivity-edges): all-edge model per **ADR-0111 revised** (provider/instance are edges, not FK) — **supersedes FU-1 (provider FK), FU-2 (instance FK), FU-11 (polymorphic provider)**. `EntityKind += Api`; `RelationshipType += InstanceOf, − PartOf`; `RelationshipTypeRules` enables `ProvidesApiFor`/`ConsumesApiFrom` ({App,Service}→Api) + `InstanceOf` (Service→Application); `CatalogEntityLookup` resolves Api nodes (422/enrichment/either-team authz). One API contract can have N provider edges (driving case). FE hygiene: dropped `partOf` from relationship UI + shared `isRenderableKind` guard (graph + relationships list) — API-node rendering deferred to **FU-A**. Data migration `PurgePartOfRelationships` purges stranded `PartOf` rows (found via ADR-0084 browser check). Spec/plan/deep-review + DoD ledger: `docs/superpowers/verification/2026-07-04-catalog-api-connectivity-edges/`. New follow-ups: FU-A (API graph UI), FU-B (derived exposure/depends), FU-C (async), FU-D (System + PartOf return), FU-E (unified view).
- [x] E-02.F-03.S-02 — Register async API with AsyncAPI spec — *shipped 2026-07-07 (catalog-async-api-spec-storage): unified API entity + `AsyncApi` style + `catalog_api_specs` spec storage via PUT/GET /apis/{id}/spec, `HasSpec` flag on `Api`, ADR-0112 + ADR-0111 amendment; UI/versions/broker-edges deferred.* **Spec UI + configurable cap follow-up shipped 2026-07-07 (catalog-api-spec-ui):** attach/view spec (file + paste + JSON/YAML) on API detail page (all styles) via raw-fetch data layer; `Spec` indicator column on Apis list (ADR-0107 field-addition: column ✓, sort ✗, filter deferred); 5 MiB cap moved to configurable `Catalog:ApiSpec:MaxContentBytes` (default 5 MiB, validated 1 KiB–50 MiB, `IValidateOptions` fail-fast), domain byte-cap dropped, endpoint enforces configured value + names it in the 400 (ADR-0112 amended). Spec rendering (Phase 3), version history (E-21), broker edges (FU-C), has-spec filter — deferred. Verification `docs/superpowers/verification/2026-07-07-catalog-api-spec-ui/`.
- [x] E-02.F-03.S-03 — Unified sync/async API view per service — *sub-slice A (unified sync/async API view + on-read derived exposure) **merged PR #63** (2026-07-08). Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-08-catalog-unified-api-view-design.md`; ledger `docs/superpowers/verification/2026-07-08-catalog-unified-api-view/dod.md`. Registry: `docs/design/list-filter-registry.md` (API surface panel row).*
  - FU-B (derived service↔service `depends-on`, ADR-0111 §5) decomposed into two sub-slices. **B1 — derived depends-on in `/graph` + dashed explorer edges** implemented+verified on branch `feat/catalog-derived-dependencies` (2026-07-09): pure `DerivedDependencies.Compute` helper (mutation 89.74%, core 100% killed) + graph-traversal wiring (drives discovery, explicit-wins, provenance) + FE dashed edges/legend. All blocking DoD gates green (gate-10 **visual** pending user browser-verification — Playwright MCP unavailable this session; gate-11 PR-runner pending). Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-09-catalog-derived-service-dependencies-design.md`, plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-09-catalog-derived-dependencies-b1.md`, ledger `docs/superpowers/verification/2026-07-09-catalog-derived-dependencies/b1/dod.md`. **B2** (next plan): `/derived-dependencies` bounded endpoint + mini-graph merge + read-only `DerivedDependenciesSection`.
  - **B2 — `/derived-dependencies` endpoint + mini-graph merge + read-only `DerivedDependenciesSection`** implemented on branch `feat/catalog-derived-dependencies-b2` (2026-07-09): shared `DerivedEdgeLoader`+`DerivedProvenanceNames` extracted from `GraphTraversalHandler` (DRY, behavior-preserving); bounded `GET /catalog/derived-dependencies?entityId=` (service-only, `entityId`-only shape, unknown/non-service/cross-tenant → 422) + `GetDerivedDependenciesHandler` (Dependencies/Dependents split); read-only `DerivedDependenciesSection` on service detail; derived dashed edges merged into the per-service mini-graph via `toGraphModel`. Real-seam 7/7 (incl. explicit-wins + cross-tenant 422); web 753/753. Plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-09-catalog-derived-dependencies-b2.md`, ledger `docs/superpowers/verification/2026-07-09-catalog-derived-dependencies/b2/dod.md`.

**E-04.F-02: Relationship Visualization**
- [x] E-04.F-02.S-01 — Embedded mini dependency graph (catalog-dependency-mini-graph, 2026-06-26; read-only 1-hop React Flow graph above the Dependencies/Dependents tables on Application + Service detail pages; reuses the 1b relationship endpoint; standalone /graph explorer + S-03–S-06 deferred)
- [x] E-04.F-02.S-02 — Relationship table below mini-graph (satisfied without a dedicated slice: the Dependencies/Dependents tables shipped in Slice 1b `RelationshipsSection` (2026-06-25) and the mini-graph (2026-06-26) was placed directly above them — `ApplicationDetailPage.tsx:105→108` / `ServiceDetailPage.tsx:121→124`; checkbox reconciled 2026-07-01. Sort/filter-by-related-entity-name remains deferred — 1b design §10)
- [x] E-04.F-02.S-03 — "Open full graph" button linking to standalone (catalog-graph-explorer, 2026-06-27; link in the mini-graph header on Application + Service detail pages → `/graph?focus=<kind>:<id>`)
- [x] E-04.F-02.S-04 — Standalone Dependency Graph Explorer (/graph) (catalog-graph-explorer, 2026-06-27; new RLS-scoped BFS endpoint `GET /catalog/graph` — depth-annotated, cycle-safe, depth 1–4/node-cap 200/`truncated`; URL-driven `/graph?focus&expand` explorer with dagre layout + read-only React Flow, expand/collapse, open-detail links. ADR-0040 second view. Filters S-05 + impact analysis S-06 deferred. On PR — CI is the authoritative full-suite/container gate; gate-6 mutation deferred (env 10-min cap). Verified end-to-end in-browser (ADR-0084). UX refinement (catalog-graph-explorer-sidebar, 2026-06-27): replaced single-click-expand + URL `?expand` with select→detail-sidebar + directional Expand/Collapse (uses the `direction` param) + `sessionStorage`-keyed local state (only `?focus` in URL; survives token-expiry re-auth); supersedes the v1 `?expand` URL-cap follow-up)
- [x] E-04.F-02.S-05 — Graph filters (Kind + Team) (catalog-graph-filters, 2026-06-29; client-side dim/fade Kind + Team filters on the standalone `/graph` explorer — canvas-overlay React Flow `<Panel>`, sessionStorage per focus, live-apply; focus never dims, edge dims iff either endpoint dims. Frontend-only, zero backend. Status/origin/domain/criticality deferred — see list-filter-registry. ADR-0040.)
- [x] E-04.F-02.S-06 — Visual impact analysis on standalone graph (catalog-graph-impact-analysis, 2026-07-10; PR #68): "Impact analysis" from a Service/Application node on `/graph` computes the transitive blast radius (everything that depends on it) over **explicit ∪ derived** `depends-on` (ADR-0111 §5), tiered by hop distance. Dedicated bounded `GET /catalog/impact?entityKind&entityId` (`catalog.read`, no new permission) reuses the `GraphResponse` contract (tier in `Depth`) via a pure `ImpactAnalysis.Compute` (BFS, cycle-safe, node-cap 200 + `truncated`; mutation 90.48%) + `GetImpactAnalysisHandler`; `entityKind=api`/malformed/empty → 400, unknown/cross-tenant → 422. FE overlay-with-merge on the explorer: impacted nodes glow by tier (tier-1 error / tier-2 warning / tier-3 success / ≥4 brand), non-impacted dim (impact overlay supersedes filters so banner count == glowing set), `ImpactBanner` "N downstream (a× tier-1, …)" + Close, error/loading states surfaced. Api-as-subject deferred FU-I1. Real-seam integ 6/6 (multi-tier incl. derived, 400/422) + FE component/page tests; all blocking DoD gates green (gate-6 mutation blocking-and-passed); gate-10 browser-verified (glow/banner/close, 0 console errors, live API 200). Verification: `docs/superpowers/verification/2026-07-10-catalog-graph-impact-analysis/dod.md`
  - Enhancement (catalog-graph-node-expand-affordance, 2026-07-10): on-node expand affordance on `/graph` — accurate in/out degree added to `GraphNodeDto` (batched RLS-scoped count in `GraphTraversalHandler`, counts explicit edges incl. boundary neighbours); `EntityGraphNode` renders active ◂/▸ expand↔collapse chevrons (shown only when a direction has unloaded neighbours) + a ⋯ context menu (expand/collapse each direction · set focus · open page) via `GraphActionsContext`. Sidebar unchanged (additive). Gate-10 caught+fixed a real z-index/handle-overlap bug jsdom missed. Follow-ups: FU-4 per-node expand-failure affordance, FU-5 E2E regression spec, FU-1 derived-aware expandability, FU-2 mini-graph affordance. Verification: `docs/superpowers/verification/2026-07-10-catalog-graph-node-expand-affordance/dod.md`

## Phase 3: Documentation (15 stories)

### E-11: Documentation Management

**E-11.F-01: Git-Synced Markdown Documentation**
- [ ] E-11.F-01.S-01 — Import and render markdown from docs/ folder
- [ ] E-11.F-01.S-02 — Auto-sync docs on git push
- [ ] E-11.F-01.S-03 — Navigation sidebar for multi-page docs

**E-11.F-02: Sync API Documentation (OpenAPI/gRPC/GraphQL)**
- [x] E-11.F-02.S-01 — Render OpenAPI specs as interactive docs (openapi-spec-render, 2026-07-10; PR #69): read-only **Scalar** (`@scalar/api-reference-react`) render replacing the raw `<pre>` on the API detail page. Content-detected OpenAPI/Swagger (`detectSpecKind`, top-level-key-only) → rendered by default with a **Rendered⇄Raw toggle**; every non-OpenAPI/malformed spec (gRPC/GraphQL/AsyncAPI/garbage) keeps the raw view. `OpenApiRender` encapsulates Scalar behind a logging error-boundary (never blank-page, ADR-0084), lazy-loaded so the ~2.8 MB chunk stays out of the main bundle (Tailwind-v4 `@layer` order per ADR-0094). **Read-only enforced**: `hideClientButton` + `hideTestRequestButton` + scoped CSS hiding Scalar's interactive API client — gate-10 browser verification caught that `hideTestRequestButton` alone leaves the live "Send Request" client reachable (Scalar #7741) and fixed it. Frontend-only (no backend/contract/permission change); gate-5 real-seam + gate-6 mutation **N/A**. All blocking DoD gates green (build/suite 811, web image, /simplify, reviews 2/7/8/9, gate-10 browser: render/toggle/AsyncAPI-fallback/XSS-sanitized/0-console-errors, CI #69). **AsyncAPI folded in (see F-03.S-01)** — same `SpecRender` component (renamed from `OpenApiRender`; folder `components/spec/`); GraphQL/gRPC rendering + try-it-out still deferred (F-02.S-02). FU-1: Playwright E2E regression for the read-only lock. Verification: `docs/superpowers/verification/2026-07-10-openapi-spec-render/dod.md`
- [ ] E-11.F-02.S-02 — Render gRPC proto files as browsable docs
- [ ] E-11.F-02.S-03 — Versioned API docs aligned with deployments
- [ ] E-11.F-02.S-04 — API "Definition" tab (tabbed entity-detail layout) — **cross-cutting / likely global impact.** Move the spec render off the API detail overview onto a dedicated `Overview | Definition | Relationships` tab. Rationale (2026-07-10 research): neither Backstage nor Compass renders a spec inline on the overview — Backstage uses a full-width **Definition** tab, Compass a dedicated **API specification** sidebar section with endpoint drill-down. A tab gives Scalar a full canvas (its own sidebar already handles per-operation nav) and defers the ~2.8 MB chunk until the tab is opened. **Introduces a tabbed detail-page layout that should generalize to Service + Application detail pages (E-03) — likely warrants an ADR + brainstorm before implementation** (react-aria `Tabs`, ADR-0094; heed the `isRowHeader`/blank-page gotcha in ADR-0084). Optional Compass-style "N endpoints" teaser on Overview. **Interim shipped** (openapi-spec-render, PR #69): spec section moved to the end of the API detail page, below Relationships. Spec-version diffing/changelog is separate (S-03).

**E-11.F-03: Async API Documentation**
- [x] E-11.F-03.S-01 — Render AsyncAPI specs (v2.x/v3.x) (openapi-spec-render, 2026-07-10; PR #69): **folded into the S-01 spec-render slice** — Scalar renders AsyncAPI (1.x/2.x/3.x, auto-upgraded to 3.x) through the same `SpecRender` component as OpenAPI. `detectSpecKind` now recognizes the top-level `asyncapi` key → rendered by default with the Rendered⇄Raw toggle; channels/operations/messages render. Read-only enforcement (`hideClientButton` + `hideTestRequestButton` + scoped CSS) verified to cover AsyncAPI's interactive controls too — gate-10 browser-verified (renders, 0 visible send/connect/subscribe controls, client dialog hidden, XSS sanitized, 0 console errors). No extra library or backend change. CloudEvents/schema-registry/changelog (F-03.S-02/S-03) not in scope.
