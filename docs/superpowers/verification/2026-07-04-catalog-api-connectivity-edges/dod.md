## Gate detail

### 1 — Build (`TreatWarningsAsErrors=true`)
**Status:** ✅ PASS — `dotnet build Kartova.slnx -c Debug` → 0 warnings, 0 errors (re-run after each code-mutating gate). Re-run after migration commit pending.

### 2 — Per-task subagent reviews (spec + quality)
**Status:** ✅ PASS — Tasks 1–4 each implemented + reviewed clean (agent reports in `.superpowers/sdd/task-*-report.md`; ledger `.superpowers/sdd/progress.md`). Fixes applied 06cd66b, 840cecd.

### 3 — Full test suite (unit + arch + integration real-seam)
**Status:** ✅ PASS — `dotnet test Kartova.slnx` green at a5af75c: Catalog.IntegrationTests 244, Catalog.Tests 187, ArchitectureTests 69, all assemblies pass. Real-seam create/graph tests hit real JWT + Postgres/RLS. Terminal re-verify after migration pending.

### 4 — Container build (images CI job)
**Status:** ✅ PASS — `ci-local.sh images` PASS at 840cecd. Re-run after migration (migrator image includes the new migration) pending.

### 5 — `/simplify` against branch diff
**Status:** ✅ PASS — 4 angle-agents; applied 3 cleanups (shared `isRenderableKind`, merged api-pair rule arm, DataRow valid-pair test) in 840cecd; skipped `SeedApiAsync` hoist (per-file convention). See `gate-findings.yaml`.

### 6 — Mutation loop (blocking — Domain rule logic changed)
**Status:** ✅ PASS — Stryker on `Kartova.Catalog.Domain` (`--since:master`): **100.00% mutation score** on changed files (`RelationshipTypeRules.cs` + `EntityKind`/`RelationshipType`); all tested mutants killed, 149 ignored by since-filter (unchanged), 121 by mutation-type filter. (CI `stryker` job only validates config routing, so this real run satisfies the blocking gate.)

### 7 — `requesting-code-review` (opus whole-branch)
**Status:** ✅ PASS — opus whole-branch review: no blocking; 1 should-fix (FE graph mis-nav) + nits → fixed 06cd66b. Distinct lens from per-task reviews.

### 8 — `review-pr` (pr-review-toolkit)
**Status:** ✅ PASS — `code-reviewer` (no findings ≥80 confidence) + `silent-failure-hunter` (null→422/RLS + precedence sound; 1 LOW note: no dedicated cross-tenant-Api 422 test — accepted, same mechanism as verified kinds).

### 9 — `deep-review`
**Status:** ✅ PASS — `./deep-review.md`. Found the relationships-**list** render path (`RelationshipsSection`) wasn't guarded like the graph → fixed e15fa3a. No blocking.

### Manual / Playwright verification (ADR-0084)
**Status:** ✅ PASS — logged in (admin@orga), app detail → Add-relationship dialog **Type dropdown offers only "Depends on"** (no "Part of"); Target kind = application/service (no api, FU-A deferred). **Found a real 500** (`GET /relationships` direction=incoming/all) from a stray `type='PartOf'` row unmappable after enum removal — fresh test DBs missed it. Fixed via data migration `PurgePartOfRelationships` + dev-DB purge; re-verified: dependency graph + Dependencies + Dependents all render, **zero console errors**. Evidence: `./verify-add-relationship-dialog.png`.

### Terminal re-verify (build + full suite after gates 5–9)
**Status:** ✅ PASS — at 9f2a625: `dotnet build Kartova.slnx -c Debug` → 0/0; `dotnet test Kartova.Catalog.IntegrationTests` → 245/245 (the `PurgePartOfRelationships` migration runs at fixture setup, validating the RLS-toggle SQL on fresh DBs).

### Pre-push CI mirror (`scripts/ci-local.sh`)
**Status:** ✅ PASS at 840cecd (backend/images/stryker/frontend/helm all PASS). Re-run (or `backend images`) after migration commit pending before push.
